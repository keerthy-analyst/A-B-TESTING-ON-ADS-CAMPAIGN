# A/B TESTING ON ADS CAMPAIGN 
## CASE STUDY 
A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers.

## First of all understand the concept of A/B TESTING
To choose the best marketing strategy, A/B testing involves analyzing two marketing strategies that can efficiently and effectively convert more traffic into sales or your desired goal. A/B testing is a valuable concept that every Data Science professional should be familiar with.

# CASE STUDY ON A/B TESTING
In the A/B tests, we analyse the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for the next marketing campaigns. For instance, when I launched an Instagram advertising campaign to promote my Instagram post for the first time ever. The target audience of my first ad campaign was not the same as the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the second ad campaign's audience due to its better reach and followers than the first one.

That's what A/B testing is all about,Your objective can be to stimulate sales, subscribers or traffic, but when we decide on the best marketing strategy. Based on results from our previous marketing campaigns, this is nothing but an A/B testing.
